## Description

This repo is an experiment to see if I can get a working GBA dev environment in a devcontainer.
It mostly uses instructions from [the TONC guide](https://gbadev.net/tonc/setup.html) to get things working.

## Tools
- devkitARM (compiler)
- mGBA (gba emulator, doesn't run properly in the devcontainer yet you'll need to install this yourself)
- devcontainer (the dev environment)

## To develop

- Run `make` to build the ROM
- Open the ROM in a GBA emulator to test it
